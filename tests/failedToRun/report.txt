Egcd2.java 16 invariants at location line 51. highest degree is 5; 7 vars used; 18 terms took 4.22 seconds on average
Egcd2.java, Egcd3.java and Geo.java when tracing line 32 fails. I don't understand the following output. That's where DIG gets stuck
"data.symstates:DEBUG:depth diff If(And(c <= k, c <= q, 0 >= c),
   c <= 10 + s,
   If(And(k <= c, k <= q, 0 >= k),
      k <= 10 + s,
      If(And(q <= c, q <= k, 0 >= q),
         q <= 10 + s,
         0 <= 10 + s))): sat @ depth 10, unsat @ depth 11"
Knuth.java fails because JPF does not support Math.sqrt
Ps6.java fails due to error from JPF (I think). The following error " error #1: gov.nasa.jpf.vm.NoUncaughtExceptionsProperty "java.lang.AssertionError  at Ps6.mainQ(Ps6.java:7)..." is in the output of JPF when I ran the last command dig runs before failing with the following warning "data.symstates:WARNING:ignore CON: x = 220825 (larger than 200000)"
Geo3.java even when I used --maxdeg 3 DIG generates invariants that are not strong enough to imply known invariants
Lcm2.java only works when --nominmaxplus flag is used
CohenCu.java and Sqrt1.java: I haven't figured out why they fail. It seems that dig is able to get symbolic states but fail after that.
